# The live (Pyodide) lane

Optional client-side recompute, like SimLab: load Pyodide in a web worker, load the inlined engine sources
(`frontend/public/pyodide/sources.json`, produced by `copy-data.mjs`), and call
`pipeline.live.run_trace_json(case_id|params, seed)`, which uses ONLY `pipeline/model/` (pure-Python,
Pyodide-safe), so the live engine shares the offline code path.

Key points:
- The live engine **may be a reduced/surrogate model**, not the full offline SOTA one, that's expected.
- Eligibility is decided by the [gate](03_the-gate.md); a case the gate marks `precompute` is replayed from the
  committed artifact instead.
- **Replay is always the fallback** (ADR-0054): a product can ship with this lane dormant and still be fully
  functional. The template's `frontend/src/pyodide/worker.ts` is a stub, wire Pyodide there per product.
