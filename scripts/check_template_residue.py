"""Fail an INSTANTIATED product repo that still ships template residue (ADR-0057 / ADR-0061).

The archetype template ships an intentional example PIPELINE (not a package, not a lab) (`data-pipeline/pipeline/`, an SIR model,
`EX0*` baked cases) so a fresh clone runs end to end. Instantiation is supposed to REPLACE all of
it with the real product; five shipped products proved that replacement is easy to forget, leaving
SIR/Pyodide/EX0* text presented as product docs. This guard makes that structurally impossible.

It is a no-op in the template itself: the template root carries a `.template-source` sentinel, and
instantiation deletes it (see the README "Instantiate" steps). With the sentinel present the guard
prints a note and exits 0; once it is gone (a real product) the guard enforces a clean repo.

Scanned set = git-tracked files only (never venvs / node_modules / data caches). Exit 1 on any hit.
